[TODO]

[high level]
Get the basic status pass/fail working simply based on the %, no profile numbers
  -> Need to get the containerized server with params working (apache)
  -> Setup server merge -> master hook to update current coverage
  -> Gracefully handle test failures? Blow up in travis mode?

[Server]
* Need to get things containerized up, including the apache configuration
and parameterization of the entrypoint. Consider accepting some kind of json
as an argument and parsing in python script for writing out to config?

* Github hooks for new commits to master POST /hook,
  these need to trigger a full update

* ! Error handling, what happens when builds break?
  -> Prevent updating test state on failures

[Travis Client]
* report results $server/reports/sha

[Nice to have]
* Config file (probably higher priority)
  -> Started this, could probably be done better, but travis has a notion of it
* Better logging
* Proper setup.py (setuptools?) install
* (server) Check if running against branch other than master? Checkout branch if so
* Manual refresh? PUT /coverage
  -> Compose reusable coverage trigger

[On deck]
* Accept server report uploads File uploads!
  -> These need to be authenticated!
travis !!  -> Need to enhance this to write .profile coverage html
travis !! * tarball coverage html and upload to server
