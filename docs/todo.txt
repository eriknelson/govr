[TODO]

[Server]
* Server init
  X * needs to verify the state directory exists or create it
  X * If doesn't exist, server should get passed project name on start:
    --git-project=https://github.com/eriknelson/goverhub-ex.git
    pull this down if it doesn't already exist and deposit in state dir
    /srv/govr
    /var/lib/govr/project/ansible-service-broker
  X * Run initial coverage if not done so, write to coverage file
  X * Hash badge url and clober master-coverage.svg with -> $hash.svg

* Server coverage
  * Return current coverage on GET /coverage

* Accept server report uploads File uploads!
  -> These need to be authenticated!

* Manual refresh? PUT /coverage
  -> Compose reusable coverage trigger

* Github hooks for new commits to master POST /hook,
  these need to trigger a full update

* ! Error handling, what happens when builds break?

[Travis Client]
* Needs to be passed in govr-server location
* Should run coverage report (have that now) -> new_coverage
  -> Need to enhance this to write .profile coverage html
* get current_coverage from govr-server
* Handle >= pass or < fail against tested sha
* tarball coverage html and upload to server
* report results $server/reports/sha

[Nice to have]
* Config file (probably higher priority)
* Better logging
* Proper setup.py (setuptools?) install
* (server) Check if running against branch other than master? Checkout branch if so
